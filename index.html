                    I am a coder, gamer, and hiker. I worked in QA for about 2 years, and recieved my Bachelors in 
                    Computer Science from SFSU. Durring my time at SFSU I attended several internships, which I 
                    found helpful in getting experience with a variety of different programming languages. I am 
                    currently undergoing a Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp out of UC Berkeley Extension.

                    I grew up in the bay area, moving from Berkeley to Oakland. One of the things I really enjoy is 
                    traveling to all the different parks. There is all of this park land stretching from Pinole to 
                    Hayward and beyond. It also helps that the weather is almost always beautiful, making it easier 
                    get out to nature and take a nice walk.

                    Currently my favorite game is Hollow Knight. It's a game about a bug traveling through caverns, 
                    learning about the ancient civilization that once inhabited the area known as Hollow Nest. I 
                    would definately recommend picking this game up.
